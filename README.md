# disease-diagnose-model
This model predicts chronic or acute diseases and teaches treatment plans based on the user's complaints. This model currently simply predicts a few symptoms. In the future, this model will use text, images, and voice as user input and will present not only diseases but also treatment measures to the user. Also it will also be able to organize direct consultations with doctors. Of course, this is not a completed plan yet. In the future, this model will continue to be updated by incorporating user needs.
